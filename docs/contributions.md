# Contributing guidelines

We'd love to accept your patches!

If you have improvements to pdnsAdmin, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the
[issues](https://github.com/pdnsadmin/pdnsadmin/issues).
These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside
contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now.

If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.

I would like to say thanks a lot to all contributors who love pdnsadmin and decide to improve it better!
Please feel free to reach us via *admin [@] pdnsadmin.com* if you have any inquiries
